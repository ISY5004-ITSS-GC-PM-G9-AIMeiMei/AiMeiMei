## üîß Environment

This code was tested with the following dependencies:

- `pytorch==1.7.1` (with CUDA 11.0)
- `einops==0.3.0`
- `numpy==1.18.3`
- `opencv-python==4.2.0`
- `scipy==1.4.1`
- `tqdm==4.45.0`
- `json==2.0.9`

## üîç Fine-tuning on AVA Dataset

We fine-tuned the MUSIQ model on the **AVA (Aesthetic Visual Analysis)** dataset, which provides aesthetic quality ratings for over 250,000 images.

### ‚úÖ Modifications:

- The original ResNet50 backbone (pretrained on ImageNet) is retained.
- Input resolution is adapted to support AVA images (various sizes).
- The model is fine-tuned using aesthetic scores from AVA.
- We adjusted the regression head to better fit AVA‚Äôs aesthetic distribution.

## üìÇ Model Setup

Before running inference, make sure you place the required model files correctly:

- Download **ResNet50 weights** from [here](https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet50-0676ba61.pth)
  - Rename it as `resnet50.pth`
  - Place it in:  
    ```bash
    ../MUSIQ/model/resnet50.pth
    ```

- Ensure your fine-tuned checkpoint is named `epoch100.pth` and placed in:[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SG_f9T4eVIyhRBVpGy8LlQiDCMwiHb0O/view?usp=sharing)
  ```bash
  ../MUSIQ/checkpoints/epoch100.pth
  ```

---

## üöÄ Inference

To run inference:

```bash
python inference.py
```

Edit the following variables inside `inference.py`:

- `dirname`: path to the folder of test images
- `checkpoint`: path to the trained model (e.g., `checkpoints/epoch100.pth`)
- `result_score_txt`: file path to save the output scores
